                <p>We think standard rain maps are boring and, to be blunt, a little ugly. </p>
                <p>Not only that, but typical weather visualisations overlook a key feature of rain: sound.</p>
                <p>From ominous thunder to pleasant pitter-patter, the auditory experience of rainfall just isn’t captured by standard meteorology reporting. </p>
                <p>That’s why we developed Soundbath Britain, an interactive map that plays a custom song generated from near real-time rainfall data from across England, Scotland and Wales. </p>
                <p>It uses rain measurements from gauges across Britain, through an interface from Natural Resources Wales. </p>
                <p>Liam Perrot, from NRW’s Hydrometry and Telemetry team, said the data has been used by the public in many different ways since its launch, but this is the first time he’s heard of it being used to make music. </p>
                <p>“We've got a lot of data and it just seems right to make that available to the public to use it as they see fit,” Perrot said. “The more people that are using it the better.”</p>
                <p>“When you use sound, you're creating an experience of the data," said music theory expert Miriam Quick, co-founder of data sonification studio Loud Numbers. “You become immersed in a story or an emotional experience.”</p>
                <p>Her collaborator Duncan Geere has a background in meteorology and environmental science: “You can use [sound] to take people out of where they are and into an entirely different environment.” </p>
                <p>“Rainy days have this whole atmosphere. You want to have a nice cup of tea and be under a blanket,” he said. “It's quite a calming and nice thing to be in. But then a storm is completely the opposite.”</p>
                <p>Despite its inevitability, British rain is “a constant novelty,” said Cardiff-based neuroscientist and author Dean Burnett. </p>
                <p>An expert on the science of emotion, including emotions evoked by sound, Burnett said our rain is an ever-present background noise, playing out as low-level stress and conversation fodder. </p>
                <p>“Our weather is on shuffle, essentially. You've got familiar tracks, but what order they’re played in is anyone's guess.” </p>
